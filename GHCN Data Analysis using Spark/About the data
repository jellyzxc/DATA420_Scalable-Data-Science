DATA
In this assignment we will study some of the weather data contained in the Global Historical Climate
Network (GHCN), an integrated database of climate summaries from land surface stations around the
world. The data covers the last 175 years and is collected from more than 20 independent sources,
each of which have been subjected to quality assurance reviews.
